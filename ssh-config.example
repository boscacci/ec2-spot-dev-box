# ~/.ssh/config snippet for iac-dev-box
#
# Recommended pattern: include generated host configs.
# The iac-dev-box repo can generate/update one automatically after each
# `terraform apply`, so `ssh dev-box` keeps working even as spot IPs change.
#
# One-time setup:
#
#   mkdir -p ~/.ssh/config.d
#
# Then add this to your ~/.ssh/config:

Include ~/.ssh/config.d/*.conf

# After `terraform apply`, run:
#
#   ~/repos/iac-dev-box/scripts/update_ssh_config.sh
#
# Then:
#
#   ssh dev-box
